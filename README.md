# Genetic-Algorithm
This program uses a Genetic Algorithm written in Python to find the best values to maximize the (arbitrary) function,

                           -4a + 2b + (-3.5)c + (-5)d + 11e + (-4.7)f

 Where a, b, c, d, e, and f are values randomly initialized and then improved on by the algorithm.
